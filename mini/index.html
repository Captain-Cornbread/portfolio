		<p>Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is truly an almighty mountain. Be brave. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Let's build some happy little clouds up here. There it is. And right there you got an almighty cloud. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. It is a lot of fun. It's cold, but it's beautiful. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. The light is your friend. Preserve it. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. See there, told you that would be easy. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. We'll play with clouds today. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Let the paint work. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. There are no limits in this world. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. You can do it. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special.</p>

<p>Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. Take your time. Speed will come later. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Use your imagination, let it go. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. It's important to me that you're happy. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Let's get wild today. That's crazy. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. What the devil. Imagination is the key to painting. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. There we go. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. We need dark in order to show light. Don't fight it, use what happens. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. Only eight colors that you need.</p>

<p>Trees grow however makes them happy. Now then, let's play. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. We have a fantastic little sky! Let's get crazy. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A little happy sunlight shining through there. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Son of a gun. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. We'll have a super time. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals.</p>
